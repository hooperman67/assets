<p>04:00, 14 Sep 2025</p><p>Celtic's 12th man might not be inside Rugby Park when John Beaton gets proceedings underway this afternoon.</p><p>But <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/luke-mccowan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke McCowan</a> insists it’s up to the 11 players <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/brendan-rodgers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brendan Rodgers</a> sends out to face Kilmarnock to bring their own noise - and silence the home support.</p><p>Having turned the volume up in their protests against the Parkhead board in recent weeks, furious Hoops fans plan to leave the Chadwick Stand sitting in an empty silence for the first 12 minutes of this afternoon’s encounter.</p><p>The decibels in the away end will no doubt sky rocket after that. But McCowan is hopeful by then the Hoops will already have found their roar.</p><p>Despite the frenzied clamour engulfing the Parkhead hierarchy over the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/champions-league" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Champions League</a> qualifying disaster and transfer window flop McCowan is adamant the players are focused on producing on the park.</p><p>He insists the off-field aggro hasn’t fed into the dressing room.

I'm sure the Killie fans will be singing and us players will just need to bring our atmosphere that we always do.</p><p>“Hopefully after the 12th minute it'll be loud again and the players can just focus on the game.

<p>22:30, 13 Sep 2025</p><p>Luke McCowan has shot down claims that Celtic are toiling - insisting <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/brendan-rodgers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brendan Rodgers</a>’ players ARE in a good place.</p><p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kilmarnock-fc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kilmarnock</a> striker Djenairo Daniels stoked the fire ahead of Sunday's Rugby Park showdown by stating the Ayrshiremen are ready to exploit the escalating off-field feud between Hoops fans and the boardroom after a disastrous transfer window.</p><p>Rodgers himself has been targeted by a Parkhead insider who accused him of trying to engineer an exit and tearing the club apart - and hit back on Friday by calling for the guilty party to resign.</p><p>Further protests planned on Sunday will see sections of the away support stay out of Rugby Park for the opening 12 minutes.</p><p>And, speaking this week, Daniels said: “<a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Celtic</a> are not really in a good place at the moment and we will take advantage of that.”</p><p>But McCowan insists the champions are rock solid and have nothing to prove - and take pride in the start they’ve made to the league campaign.</p><p>He said: “As players we're in a good place, joint top of the league (coming into the weekend) and started the league campaign well.</p><p>“It's not about proving anybody wrong or showing anybody that Celtic are in a good place.</p><p>“It’s about us players putting on a performance that after it you can have a nice chat about and know that, ok there's been a lot of noise but the players there are putting that to bed quite early. Go and show with a good performance that that’s all it is - noise.</p><p>“The players need to go and perform regardless of what's happening on the outside and need to go and search for the three points. The main focus is on the challenge on Sunday.</p><p>“You've got to take great pride in how we’ve started.

<p>With the clock ticking down on deadline day, Celtic ended up paying over £5m for Tounekti.</p><p>Adam Idah was sold despite clear assurances that the striker would be going nowhere until a suitable replacement was secured. Instead, free agent Kelechi Iheanacho was signed up after the window closed.</p><p>Asked prior to the long trip to Almaty what would get his players back to their usual levels "competition," came the quickfire reply from Rodgers.</p><p>Not coaching, not cajoling, not training. Competition.</p><p>The manager has been asking for it since the turn of the year. The sale of Kyogo Furuhashi with no thought for a replacement is still a puzzler eight months on.</p><p>Some £30m had been spent on Idah, Arne Engels, Auston Trusty and Paulo Bernardo in the previous summer.</p><p>This time round, Rodgers wanted quality, not quantity. What he got was the return of Kieran Tierney and a decent looking forward in Benjamin Nygren along with several "club signings" that he has largely overlooked.</p><p>Tounekti, Iheanacho, Balikwisha and Marcelo Saracchi may yet prove to be worthwhile additions but arrived once the Champions League horse had bolted.</p><p>You then have regular performer Daizen Maeda looking a shadow of himself after a summer move was blocked.</p></div>

  <p class="date">September 13, 2025, 12:13 pm | <small>Glasgow Times | Celtic</small></p>
<p>Rodgers held court during an explosive press conference yesterday in which he blasted the "cowardly" figure at <a href="https://www.glasgowtimes.co.uk/sport/celtic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Celtic</a> who supposedly briefed against him to the media.</p><p>The Northern Irishman insists he would be happy to sign a new deal despite those leaks suggesting he was trying to work his exit from the club.</p><p>Celtic fans, furious at their club's handling of the transfer market, are planning a protest at tomorrow's game against Kilmarnock. They will not enter the ground until the 12th minute as they make a stand.</p><p>Boyd says Rodgers has expertly created a situation where the board are taking all the heat and he avoids flak for his role in failing to reach the Champions League proper.</p><p>"Who’s kidding who?", he asked in the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/15335488/brendan-rodgers-celtic-fans-soap-opera-excuses-kris-boyd/?ref=ed_direct" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scottish Sun</a>. "There is more chance of me being the Celtic manager next season than him.</p><p>"Rodgers denies trying to engineer an exit, but all this talk about aligning with the board and signing a contract extension is pie in the sky. That won’t happen. He will leave at the end of the season, if not before.</p><p>"Rodgers knows his relationship with the club’s hierarchy is probably as fragile as it’s ever been. All is not rosy at Celtic, and the manager is playing a blinder in getting the diehard fans on his side.</p><p>"Incidentally, are those supporters now backing him the same ones who chanted vile songs about him at Tynecastle when he did his disappearing act to Leicester City back in 2019? That’s all conveniently been forgotten about now and Rodgers has them eating out of the palm of his hand.</p><p>"All the fury is being directed at the board, when so much of the blame for the Champions League exit should be pinned on the manager and his players.</p><p>"It was good to see that Rodgers did finally take some responsibility for his team failing to score a goal against Kairat Almaty across 210 minutes in the play-off. It’s only taken him over a fortnight to do that, so credit where it’s due."</p><p>Boyd has also cast doubt on the...</p></div>

  <p class="date">September 13, 2025, 9:45 am | <small>Glasgow Times | Celtic</small></p>
<p>‘Bloody Magic’ is the headline on an image of his wounded head, vaseline plastered over a gash inflicted by the flailing right arm of <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/topics/rangers-fc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rangers</a> left-back David Robertson. “I was elbowed in the head,” the former <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/topics/celtic-fc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Celtic</a> striker recalls now. “But back in the day you went off and got it stitched up and got straight back on.”</p><p>Minutes earlier Payton had thumped a John Collins corner into the net in a rare win over Rangers for Liam Brady’s Celtic team. A frantic, blood-and-thunder battle symptomatic of Old Firm games of the past Payton had signed from Middlesbrough for £600,000 a year earlier. A direct, physical, up and at ’em British centre forward, the cut and thrust of Scottish football seemed to suit him.</p><p>“Mark Hateley is in the background and what that picture reminds me of is the intensity of the Celtic and Rangers games back then,” he says.</p><p>“It was so much more physical than it is now. Rangers back then had Hateley, [Richard] Gough, Trevor Steven, Ally McCoist and John Brown and the players were literally kicking lumps out of each other. But any striker who goes to Celtic – whether it’s today or 30 years ago – knows that if they can score the winner against Rangers then that’s what it’s all about. That’s why, at that time, scoring the winner against Rangers felt like it was worth all the blood and the stitches.”</p><p>Recent events have given him cause to reconsider that judgement. Over the course of a 16-year career Payton scored 226 goals in 588 appearances for seven clubs. His first stop was Hull City, where he practiced heading drills, day in and day out, with former <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/local-news/aberdeen-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aberdeen</a> striker Dean Windass.</p><p>Earlier this year Windass was diagnosed with stage two dementia after he was persuaded to undergo a brain scan by his friend John Stiles – son of Nobby, the England World Cup winner who died after a long fight with the same illness.</p><p>Payton had kept in touch with his former team-mate on and off. When he confided in him over his own...</p></div>

<p>If <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/25182504.ex-celtic-boss-postecoglou-leads-spurs-european-glory/?ref=ed_direct" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tottenham Hotspur had retained Ange Postecoglou</a>’s services after they had lifted the <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/topics/europa-league/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Europa League</a> back in May then we would maybe know now if the game plan which <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/uk-sport/25452751.nottingham-forest-appoint-former-tottenham-boss-ange-postecoglou/?ref=ed_direct" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Greek-Australian</a> deployed in the final against Manchester United was a one-off experiment or the new norm.</p><p>There was a final Premier League game against Brighton at the Tottenham Stadium a few days after the narrow 1-0 triumph over their hapless (and hopeless) Old Trafford adversaries in the San Mames Stadium in Bilbao.</p><p>But that dead rubber, which the hosts lost 4-1, was really just another opportunity for jubilant Spurs fans to celebrate their boys winning their first trophy in 17 years and their first piece of European silverware in 41 years.</p><p>Those meaningless 90 minutes offered no insight, none whatsoever, into how Postecoglou intended to approach matches in the wake of the greatest accomplishment of his long and varied coaching career.</p><p>Would his sides revert to pressing their opponents high up the pitch, trying to dominate possession and looking to entertain punters with attractive and offensive football?</p><p>Read more:</p><p>Or would they continue, as they had done against United in the Europa League final, to sit deep, concentrate on defending their penalty box and look to get forward on the counter?</p><p>Those were questions which many fans and pundits in English football – who had lauded and derided the <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/football/23566053.ange-postecoglou-refuses-commit-future-celtic-treble/?ref=ed_direct" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">former Celtic manager</a>’s swashbuckling tactics in equal measure during his eventful two year reign in North London – wanted answered following the Spanish sojurn.</p><p>They will, with Postecoglou replacing Nuno Espirito Santo at Nottingham Forest this week, get their wish now. It will be fascinating seeing if Big Ange intends to stick to his long-held beliefs or if he feels he needs to temper his attacking instincts somewhat to flourish in the Premier League and Europa League. It could go either way.</p><p>But it is to hoped that Angeball - as the high-intensity, high-risk football which he favours was labelled during his trophy-laden spell in Scotland – is finally consigned to history and a far more pragmatic style of...</p></div>

<p>"My honest take is I thought it was a cowardly action by whoever it is," said Rodgers.</p><p>"It's not something you'd want. Certainly my relationships with the guys, I am close with here within the board, I would struggle to understand why.</p><p>"All I've tried to do is drive the club forward. Was I surprised by it? Not really.</p><p>"I'm thick skinned and it's because I want to do so well here. I'm determined.</p><p>"I know Dermot [Desmond, majority shareholder], Michael [Nicholson, chief executive], the guys I work with on a daily basis, certainly communicate on a daily basis, feel the same."</p><p>In the report by the Scottish Sun, there was no hint as to where the leak had come from, other than it said senior figures were concerned the former Liverpool boss, who previously left his role at Celtic midway through his third season, had eyes on an exit.</p><p>There was also a claim his public frustrations about the club's transfer dealings had "torn the club apart".</p><p>When asked on Friday if the person who was speaking against him should resign, Rodgers added: "I don't think there's any doubt.</p><p>"If you're sat in the position that I'm in with the weight of the club on your shoulders to be the spokesperson, to be the manager, be the psychologist and be everything, it's so important you feel supported.</p><p>"I'm pretty sure there will be some questioned asked on it as, like I said, there was quite a bit of detail in there - and wrong I may add."</p></div>
